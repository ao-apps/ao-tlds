/*
 * The Javadoc tool in Java 1.8 uses a default stylesheet that performs an
 * import of a missing resource:
 *
 * @import url('resources/fonts/dejavu.css');
 *
 * This is listed as bug 8129828:
 * https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8129828
 *
 * To avoid the overhead and delays of repeated 404's, we have created this
 * placeholder CSS file.  This will remain in place until this JDK bug is
 * resolved.
